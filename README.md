### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the lectures did a good job giving me the baseline knowledge of the new technologies and how to use them. For the labs, I feel like they were helpful, but they could have been better if we had more time to complete them, as the time allotted felt very short. Additionally, maybe using the labs instead as examples that we cna reference might be a better idea. 


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added additional features such as as the sorting as well as editing individual playlists. Also, I would have went back and restructured my code so that it is more efficient and easier to edit in the future, providing for better longevity as well as reusability.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I really enjoyed my projecte demo and am proud of what I was able to accomplish. Since I have been working and testing it throughout the entire time I was creating the application, I already knew what to expect and wasn't really suprised by anything. When looking at peers demos, I liked the UI that a lot of them implamented and would love to include some unique visual features next time such as gradients.
